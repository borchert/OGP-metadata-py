For its 2010-2030 water supply demand projections, the Council used data submitted in 2008 local comprehensive plans. Where local comprehensive plans did not contain projection data, the water demand projection method outlined in the 2007 Water Supply Planning in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area Technical Report was used to forecast water use. While the Council does not have official 2040 and 2050 water use forecasts for each community in the metropolitan area, population for these years was projected based on the amount of remaining developable land and predicted population growth trends between 2000 and 2030. 2040 and 2050 water use was forecast using the same rate of water use for 2030 multiplied by the forecasted population for 2040 and 2050.

Attributes containing 2004 population and water demand data are relative accurate, as they were based on 2004 Minnesota Department of Natural Resource water appropriations permit data and population served data reported by communities in local water supply plans.

The accuracy of 2010 - 2050 population served and demand projection data should be considered a general estimate based on the best available data. Water demand projection methods vary by community. Use of these data should recognize that community-level population and water demand projections change periodically as community development plans evolve with changing social and economic forces.&lt;/attraccr&gt;&lt;/attracc&gt;&lt;complete&gt;The entire seven county geographic area is covered&lt;/complete&gt;&lt;lineage&gt;&lt;procstep&gt;&lt;procdesc&gt;For its water supply demand projections, the Council used the 2010, 2020 and 2030 population forecasts reported in communities' 2008 water supply plans submitted to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.  Where local water supply plans did not contain projection data, the Metropolitan Council used the water demand projection method outlined in the 2007 Water Supply Planning in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area Technical Report to forecast water use. Population forecasts for 2040 and 2050 were developed specifically for this Plan to extend the water supply planning horizon to that used by Metropolitan Council's wastewater services. 2040 household forecasts were developed using the average of two growth projections: 1) the 2030-2040 growth if households grew at the same rate as projected from 2000-2030 (based upon a linear trend extrapolation), and 2) the forecasted household growth between 2020 and 2030. This average growth was added to the 2030 household forecast, which has the effect of giving 2020-2030 projected growth greater weight than overall 2000-2030 growth. 2050 population was then estimated by adding the 2030-2040 household growth to 2040 household forecasts. 

Some communities purchase their water, wholesale or retail, from other communities.  In these cases, the populations of communities purchasing their water supply were combined with the population of the community from which they purchase their water.  For example, the population forecasts for St. Paul Regional Water Services (SPRWS) include the City of St. Paul and the nine other communities served by SPRWS.

Community populations were characterized as either served or unserved. Served populations receive water from municipal supply systems, while unserved populations rely primarily on private domestic wells. Communities forecast 2010, 2020, and 2030 served population; the Council estimated 2040 and 2050 served population based on reported growth rates and assuming that after 2030 unserved populations would connect to municipal water supply systems.
  
Municipal suppliers provide water to residential, commercial, institutional and industrial customers.  The Council calculated the mean average day and maximum day water demand for each municipal water supplier.  Average day demand is the total water pumped in one year divided by the number of days in the year. Maximum day demand is the maximum volume pumped on a single day in a given year.  

The Council projected non-municipal industrial, commercial, agricultural, and other permitted water use based on 2001-2004 water use data from the DNR. It was assumed that nearly all new non-residential water use would be accounted for in the projected municipal water demands. However, in some cases, the Council assumed a reduction in non-municipal and non-residential water use in areas where land-use change is planned. For example, it was assumed that major-crop irrigation use will decrease in areas where urban development is planned.  Similarly, water use projections were lowered in areas where it is known quarry operations are going to close down and associated dewatering will cease.  Most once-through water use was removed because these permits will be terminated by the end of 2010.  While likely to grow slightly, non-crop irrigation water use was not increased because the locations of future permits are unknown.  Similarly, the Council did not account for new industrial processing demands and other special categories in its water supply demand forecasts because future permit locations are unknown.

Based on the calculated metropolitan area average residential per capita per day water use value (88 gallons per capita per day in 2004), the Council projected water demands for private water suppliers, including domestic wells and private waterworks (e.g. waterworks operated by mobile home parks, housing associations or other entities). The metropolitan area average residential per capita per day water use value is the mean of the metropolitan area municipal supplier's average residential per capita per day water supply demand .  The Council multiplied the metropolitan area average residential per capita per day water use value by the total population of each community minus the served population to obtain the private water supply (unserved population water use) average water supply demands.

Per capita daily demand for each municipal water supplier was calculated by  dividing the average and maximum daily municipal water use by the served population. Where data were insufficient to directly calculate the per capita demand factors, water supply demands were estimated based on data from municipal systems with similar characteristics. The Council multiplied the adjusted maximum day per capita values by the forecasted served population to project maximum day usage for each municipal supplier. 

Finally, to create these shapefiles, community population served and water demand projection data were then aggregated by municipal public water supplier.&lt;/procdesc&gt;&lt;/procstep&gt;&lt;srcinfo&gt;&lt;srcscale /&gt;&lt;/srcinfo&gt;&lt;procstep&gt;&lt;procdesc Sync="TRUE"&gt;Dataset copied.&lt;/procdesc&gt;&lt;srcused Sync="TRUE"&gt;N:\EQA\WaterSupply\MAPS_Make_A_Map\MAM_WaterSupply_2Mar09\MAM_WatSUp_Metadata_23Apr09\WatDemProj04_50&lt;/srcused&gt;&lt;procdate Sync="TRUE"&gt;20091208&lt;/procdate&gt;&lt;proctime Sync="TRUE"&gt;10043000&lt;/proctime&gt;&lt;/procstep&gt;&lt;/lineage&gt;&lt;/dataqual&gt;&lt;spdoinfo&gt;&lt;indspref /&gt;&lt;direct&gt;Vector&lt;/direct&gt;&lt;mgmg3obj /&gt;&lt;mgmg3til /&gt;&lt;/spdoinfo&gt;&lt;eainfo&gt;&lt;overview&gt;&lt;eaover&gt;PSW_ID - Minnesota Department of Health Minnesota Drinking Water Information System public water supplier identification number
