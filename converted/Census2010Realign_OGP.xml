Datasets used as reference include 2010 Census TIGER/Line files, 2010 NCT Census blocks, licensed Metropolitan Council 2010 Digital Orthophotography for the seven county metro area, and licensed county parcel data. 

NCompass Technologies aligned Census Blocks to their street centerline file. When Census block boundaries were not streets but MCD boundaries, they aligned them to our MCD file (available on Data Finder) and if they were school district boundaries they followed the SD boundaries we dissolved from the county parcel data. If the Census geography was so completely different that it affected the Census block boundary topology to follow our MCD or SD boundaries, they used the TIGER alignment. They used the parcel boundaries as a guide when needed, and used the aerial photography for other visible physical features for Census block boundaries (like water features, railroads, etc.). There were also times when the TIGER Census geography was not reality at all, and if a block did not really exist and had no population assigned to it, it was not included in the file. Sometimes there were multiple polygons that create a block in reality, so there is a list of Census blocks with multiple polygons. This is important if you plan to sum up any census data based on the geography file (it would count those blocks more than once). 

***The positional accuracy of TIGER features that follow non-visible features, such as municipal boundaries, school district boundaries or other political boundaries is, in some locations, significantly off or just wrong; especially in relationship to visible features, such as roads. This posed difficult challenges to improve the block boundaries to more accurate sources while maintaining the block topology created by the TIGER features. NCT and MC staff used their best judgment to decide the best solution for those block boundaries representing those situations. At times this resulted in 1) eliminating a block completely, 2) causing multiple polygon blocks, 3) the need for following a non-visible parcel boundary that best represented the TIGER feature location, or 4) simply using the TIGER feature alignment as the best solution.

LINEAGE FROM NCompass Technologies 

TIGER/Line 2010 Census Files using NCT based features - 
Processing Documentation 

Several macros and menus have been created to automate repetitive tasks and expedite manual processing. 

&amp;lt;coun&amp;gt; is used to specify the first 4 letters of the county name 

Step 1- Import TIGER files 
Move all files from county directory on CD (Tiger 2010 data, 7/1/2012, Met Council) to local directory 
import covers and info files 
separate feature classes so we know what line types delineate the blocks 
Specific block boundary arc files: 
- counblkarcs (all boundary arcs) 
- counblkext (nonvisable extensions of an existing feature) 
- counblkfence (fence lines) 
- counblkinvis (invisible features) 
- counblkmun (munics boundaries) 
- counblkprop (property lines) 
- counblkrds (roads) 
- counblkprr (railroads) 
- counblkschdis (schooldist) 
- counblkwater (water- rivers, streams, ponds, lakes) 

clip .tiff parcels into quads to allow quick drawing in AE 

Step 2- Alignment of features 
Edit UTM projected coverages 

*To expedite the process, only adjust features that delineate a block boundary. 
-speeds process and ensures that our features are geographically correct 

1. Data sources 
a. DOQ in both Tiff world and Mr. SID format 
b. County supplied parcels 
c. MCD Boundaries 2010 from Met Council 
d. School district boundaries 2010, same as provided to create census boundaries 
2. Covers to adjust, and source 
a. Individual road centerline files to county parcels and DOQs 
b. Geoareas to county parcels and DOQs 
c. Linear to county parcels and DOQs 
d. Munics to MCD boundaries 
e. County to MCD boundaries 

Step 3- Assemble NCT and Other Supplied Lines 
- Project roads, linear, and Geoareas, clip these with the county boundary 
- Use separated feature covers (from Step1) to select the appropriate linear, geoareas, munics and school district boundaries that make up block boundaries. 
- display DOQs 
- display different TIGER line types and parcels (colors pre set) 
- put selected geoareas and linear arcs to individual files. 

Step 4- Create block relationship files, and Calculate 2010 Block and Tract Values through a Relate 
Create of block relationship files: 
1. Copy and paste 2010 data table from Census web page to a new .txt file. 
2. Convert to .dbf file, data in columns 3, 4, 5, 10 is text, the rest is number format 
3. In Excel add the following headings: ST90, CO90, CT90, BLK90, PART90, ST00, CO00, CT00, BLK00, PART00 
4. Convert to info file into the COUN_census/COUN_tgr/ directory called COUN90_00 

Relate created, relate called RELATE is saved in relate info file called censusrelates 
Selects features through relate, calculate ALL00 = to ALL00 from 9_0relate1to1 info file 
Puts features to new cover in coun_tgr directory 
Projects and builds cover from SPTCMA83 to UTM 

Step 5- Combining Points and Placing Them into Linear Features 
(Continuation of above step) 
Macro continues to assembles linear features and places them into same coverage as points, so when built polygons with label points will be created. 

Step 6- Moving Points to Create Proper Polygons 
Bring up edit cover, backcovers, and menus for editing. 
Select and copy points to make sure attributes are in each poly once it is built. Utilize back covers unique symbology for each feature type to determine TIGER's intended boundary, or to see the 2010 block if available. 

Step 7- Building Polygons and Checking for Errors 
Make 4 separate checks before converting covers to shapefiles for final visual checks. 
- The first step checks for blocks that do not contain a point. 
- Second checks for block polys present in the TIGER file, but not in the dissolved %.coun%work file. 
- Third checks for tract polys present in the TIGER file, but not in the dissolved %.coun%work file 
- Fourth is a check for polygons present in the dissolved %.coun%work file, but not in the TIGER file. 
Finally the macro outputs nine shapefiles (see next step for names) for visual checks. 

Step 8- Setup ArcView Project to Begin Visual Checks 
In Arc View, bring up new project and view. Add the first 5 of the following themes and classify as follows: 
- NCT block lines - single symbol, 1pt solid line 
- TIGER block group lines - single symbol, 3pt dashed line 
- TIGER block lines - single symbol, thin (.1) solid line, contrasting color 
- Intersected polygons - unique value, classify field SAME, red fill, no outline 
- NCT block group polygons - unique value, classify field blockgroup, your choice of color schemes 
- TIGER block polygons (reference if necessary) 
- TIGER Tract lines (reference if necessary) 
- NCT block polygons (reference if necessary) 
- NCT tracts as polygons (reference if necessary) 

With the intrsct theme, classify the N (different blk00) blocks to RED with NO OUTLINE and the Y blocks to NO FILL and NO OUTLINE. 

Step 9- Append 7 Counties using ArcTools. Fixed any fixable overlap/gaps using Topology Editor. 

Step 10- Packaging and Sending Out 
Drop and calculate items and export cover to geodatabase 

LINEAGE FROM THE METROPOLITAN COUNCIL 
NCT delivered one county tile at a time. Metropolitan Council staff ran independent checks to account for all blocks, block groups and tracts. Then developed with NCT a list of any missing blocks, verifying zero population, and added to the list any blocks, block groups or tracts of more than one polygon, verifying that there were no errors in the block geography causing the multiple polygons. Council staff then visually checked each tile for block boundary errors. NCT fixed errors as needed and resent final county tiles.

After the final seven edgematched tiles were received and accepted from NCT, NCT created a final region wide geodatabase of blocks, block groups and tracts.  MC staff added and modified attribute fields with in each tile layer to match other Census files.

******** IMPORTANT ***********
CHALLENGES/PROBLEMS and SOLUTIONS 

1) Census feature alignment to DOQs/Parcel data - Although technically outside the scope of work for this contract this phase took us much longer than expected. In most cases our roads were within the right of way, but we took this opportunity to do some fine tuning that we otherwise might not have done. Alignment of Area and Linear features to the DOQs was very helpful in making our features much closer to how they actually are; unfortunately this process was also time consuming and at times created difficulties in replicating the TIGER census blocks since there are differing levels of accuracy in the TIGER data. 

2) Process of determining proper block geography - Correlating TIGER Geography with ours sometimes caused big headaches. Often times TIGER creates blocks using features that are either nonexistent, or whose locations are just incorrect. Initially these problems were very aggravating, but we were able to work through many of them with The Council and come up with solutions that would work on a systematic basis with these recurring issues. 

Met Council Note: ***The positional accuracy of TIGER features that follow non-visible features, such as municipal boundaries, school district boundaries or other political boundaries is, in some locations, significantly off or just wrong; especially in relationship to visible features, such as roads.   This posed difficult challenges to improve the block boundaries to more accurate sources while maintaining the block topology created by the TIGER features.   NCT and MC staff used their best judgment to decide the best solution for those block boundaries representing those situations.  At times this resulted in 1) eliminating a block completely, 2) causing multiple polygon blocks, 3) the need for following a non-visible parcel boundary that best represented the TIGER feature location, or 4) simply using the TIGER feature alignment as the best solution.  

3) Timing - We had difficulty completing the first few tiles on the specified dates due to a variety of problems including extra time spent aligning features, and an underestimation of the time it would take to complete the manual processing. A revised time schedule was worked out.
