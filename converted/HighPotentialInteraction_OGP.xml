It is also possible that some sensitive surface water bodies occur outside of the identified sensitive areas. It should also be noted that surface-water bodies might occur near the edge of "non-sensitive" areas that could be influenced by major aquifer withdrawals indirectly. This is particularly likely where small "islands" of non sensitive areas occur or where topographic relief is high and actual sensitive areas are small or narrow.&lt;/attraccr&gt;&lt;/attracc&gt;&lt;lineage&gt;&lt;procstep&gt;&lt;procdesc&gt;Areas that may contain sensitive surface waters were derived from surficial geology, quaternary sub-surface, bedrock geology , and potentiometric data including:

A. Surficial Geology
1)	Areas mapped as loamy till, clayey lake sediments, or other fine-grained sediments were assumed to not contain surface waters sensitive to withdrawals from the major aquifers.
a)	30 X 60 minute quads mapped by the MGS were used, where available, to determine surficial geology.
b)	Data from the Dakota County geologic atlas mapped by MGS and digitized by Dakota County were also used to define surficial geology.
c)	Data from the state-wide surficial geology mapped by the MGS were also used where other surficial geology maps were not available.
2)	In Washington County, the estimated thickness of unconsolidated surficial and subsurface materials were also taken into account (Meyer, G. and Tipping, R.G., 1998, Thicknesses of four tills within Washington County, Minnesota: Minnesota Geological Survey, Unpublished Manuscript Maps, Scale 1:50,000, four digital files.)
a)	Where there was a minimum estimated thickness of 20 ft of Till 1 and/or Till 3, surface waters were assumed to not be well connected with the major aquifers.
b)	Where there was a minimum estimated thickness of 50 ft of Till 2 and/or Till 4, surface waters were assumed to not be well connected with the major aquifers.
3)	Outside of Washington County, the sand content maps developed for the Metro Model Project (MPCA, 2000) were used to condition the unconsolidated geology.
a)	Where there was an interval (20 m) having less than or equal to 20% sand, surface waters were assumed to not be well connected with the major aquifers.
b)	The intervals are fixed, and the sand content data do not map geological units. Areas having thick low permeability units overlapping two intervals were not taken into account. This was done so that multiple thin intervals of low permeability materials were unlikely to be treated as effective confining units.
c)	Potentially sensitive areas, in terms of unconsolidated geology, were mapped by contouring the sand content point data using ESRI&amp;#174; ArcView&amp;#8482; 3.1 with the Spatial Analyst. Areas that met the criteria based on the contour delineations were then converted to polygons.

B. Bedrock Geology
1)	Areas underlain by Ordovician bedrock confining units were assumed to not be well connected with the major aquifers. Implicit in this approach was the assumption that major unconsolidated aquifers aren't present/used where Ordovician confining units occur.
a)	Ordovician confining units were defined as the Decorah Shale, the Platteville and Glenwood Formations, and the basal St. Peter Sandstone. Although the basal St. Peter Sandstone is a relatively leaky confining unit in some areas, it was considered sufficient to greatly reduce the sensitivity of overlying surface waters to withdrawals from deeper aquifers.
b)	Bedrock geology was defined by the most recently published MGS mapping data and from Southern Washington County Bedrock Study - Minnesota Geological Survey, May 2004.

 
C. Hydraulic Potential
1)	For most of the Metro area, potentiometric surface contours of the Prairie du Chien-Jordan aquifer system (25 ft) developed for the Metro Model project (MPCA, 2000) were used to approximate the potentiometric surface of the shallowest major aquifer. 
a)	These contours extent to varying distances beyond the extent of the Prairie du Chien-Jordan. The existing contours do not cover central or northern Anoka County. The depth to the potentiometric surface below water surfaces is less than 20 ft in almost all of this area, however.
2)	The contours were interpolated to grids using ESRI&amp;#174; ArcMap&amp;#8482; Spatial Analyst.
3)	The potentiometric surface grids were subtracted from the Minnesota 30 m DEM developed by MDNR and derived from USGS DEMs.
4)	The resulting depth to the potentiometric surface grids were contoured. Areas where the depth was less than or equal to 25 ft were converted to polygons.

D. Integration of Data and Analyses
1)	The non-sensitive areas determined under A and B above were removed from the areas estimated to have potentiometric surfaces less than or equal to 25 ft below the surface to produce polygons of potentially sensitive areas.

2)	Wells completed in the buried Quaternary or deeper aquifers with depths to water less than or equal to 20 ft were identified among the located wells shapefile of the MGS CWI database. These wells were plotted over the identified potentially sensitive areas and the geological data for informal visual comparison.

3)	In some areas identified as potentially sensitive, the depth to water reported in CWI exceeded 25 ft. This occurred in some areas of relatively high topographically, but also some areas identified as potentially sensitive are likely not sensitive. It is also possible that some sensitive surface water bodies occur outside of the identified sensitive areas.

4)	It should also be noted that surface-water bodies might occur near the edge of "non-sensitive" areas that could be influenced by major aquifer withdrawals indirectly. This is particularly likely where small "islands" of non sensitive areas occur or where topographic relief is high and actual sensitive areas are small or narrow.&lt;/procdesc&gt;&lt;/procstep&gt;&lt;srcinfo&gt;&lt;srcscale /&gt;&lt;/srcinfo&gt;&lt;procstep&gt;&lt;procdesc Sync="TRUE"&gt;Dataset copied.&lt;/procdesc&gt;&lt;srcused Sync="TRUE"&gt;N:\EQA\WaterSupply\MAPS_Make_A_Map\MAM_WaterSupply_2Mar09\MAM_WatSUp_Metadata_23Apr09\GwSwInteract&lt;/srcused&gt;&lt;procdate Sync="TRUE"&gt;20091208&lt;/procdate&gt;&lt;proctime Sync="TRUE"&gt;10043000&lt;/proctime&gt;&lt;/procstep&gt;&lt;/lineage&gt;&lt;/dataqual&gt;&lt;spdoinfo&gt;&lt;indspref /&gt;&lt;direct&gt;Vector&lt;/direct&gt;&lt;mgmg3obj /&gt;&lt;mgmg3til /&gt;&lt;/spdoinfo&gt;&lt;spref&gt;&lt;horizsys&gt;&lt;geograph&gt;&lt;latres /&gt;&lt;longres /&gt;&lt;geogunit /&gt;&lt;/geograph&gt;&lt;planar&gt;&lt;gridsys&gt;&lt;gridsysn&gt;UTM&lt;/gridsysn&gt;&lt;utm&gt;&lt;utmzone&gt;15N&lt;/utmzone&gt;&lt;/utm&gt;&lt;spcs&gt;&lt;spcszone /&gt;&lt;/spcs&gt;&lt;mgmg4coz /&gt;&lt;mgmg4adj /&gt;&lt;/gridsys&gt;&lt;mapproj&gt;&lt;mapprojn /&gt;&lt;mgmg4par /&gt;&lt;otherprj /&gt;&lt;/mapproj&gt;&lt;planci&gt;&lt;plandu&gt;Meters&lt;/plandu&gt;&lt;/planci&gt;&lt;/planar&gt;&lt;geodetic&gt;&lt;ellips /&gt;&lt;horizdn&gt;NAD83&lt;/horizdn&gt;&lt;/geodetic&gt;&lt;/horizsys&gt;&lt;vertdef&gt;&lt;altsys&gt;&lt;altunits&gt;Meters&lt;/altunits&gt;&lt;/altsys&gt;&lt;depthsys&gt;&lt;depthdn&gt;Mean sea level&lt;/depthdn&gt;&lt;depthdu&gt;Meters&lt;/depthdu&gt;&lt;/depthsys&gt;&lt;/vertdef&gt;&lt;/spref&gt;&lt;eainfo&gt;&lt;overview&gt;&lt;eaover&gt;FID
