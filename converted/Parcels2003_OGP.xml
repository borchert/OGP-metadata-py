The seven counties were assembled into a common coordinate system.  No attempt has been made to edgematch or rubbersheet between counties.  A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county.  Not all attributes are populated for all counties.

This is an annual version of the MetroGIS Regional Parcel Dataset that can be used with other annual versions to do change analysis and time series investigations. This dataset is intended to contain all updates to each county's parcel data through the end of 2003.  It was originally published as the 'January 1, 2004' version of the dataset. See the Currentness Reference below and the Entity and Attribute information in Section 5 for more information about the dates for specific aspects of the dataset. 

This dataset contains one record for each real estate/tax parcel polygon.  In many places a one-to-one relationship does not exist between these parcel polygons and the actual buildings or occupancy units that lie within them.  There may be many buildings on one parcel and there may be many occupancy units (e.g. apartments, stores or offices) within each building.  Additionally, no information exists within this dataset about residents of parcels.  Parcel owner and taxpayer information exists for many, but not all counties.

Some counties have also made available a parcel points dataset that includes the same attribute fields as the polygon dataset.  The point are intended to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon.  The primary example of this is the condominium.  Condominiums, by definition, are legally owned as individual, taxed real estate units.  Records for condominiums may not show up in the polygon dataset.


This is a MetroGIS Regionally Endorsed dataset.  (See http://www.metrogis.org/data/about/index.shtml#whatis for more information.)

Any questions or comments about suspected errors or omissions in this dataset can be addressed to the contact person listed in the individual county metadata.   Links to that metadata can be found in the Horizontal Positional Accuracy element below.&lt;/attraccr&gt;&lt;/attracc&gt;&lt;logic&gt;No attempt was made to edgematch or rubbersheet the seven counties, thus overlaps and gaps will exist between counties.  Not all tax parcels are represented by a unique polygon.   For example, a county might have one polygon representing a condominium complex.  Some counties have provided an additional parcel points shape file that will include points to represent such tax parcels (e.g. a point for each individual condominium).&lt;/logic&gt;&lt;complete&gt;For parcel attributes, see Section 5 of this metadata.
For parcel geography, see metadata for individual counties.

Any questions or comments about suspected errors or omissions in this dataset can be addressed to the contact person listed in the individual county metadata.   Links to that metadata can be found in the Horizontal Positional Accuracy element below.&lt;/complete&gt;&lt;posacc&gt;&lt;horizpa&gt;&lt;horizpar&gt;ANOKA:   No information provided.


CARVER:  The Horizontal Accuracy of the counties parcel dataset is, for the most part, UNDER 1' accuracy. This is possible because the County's Surveyor used COGO (Coordinate Geometry) which is a highly accurate way of plotting parcel lines. 


DAKOTA:  90% less than 2.0 feet 


HENNEPIN:  Estimated to be +or- 2 to 4 feet at section corners. Positional accuracy decreases with distance from section corners.


RAMSEY:  Digitized information is generally +or- 7 feet; some areas have been found to be +or- 30 feet. Cogo (coordinate geometry) accuracy generally is +or- 1.0 foot. 


SCOTT:  No information provided.


WASHINGTON:  Digitized features outside areas of high vertical relief (e.g. major river valleys) tested 23 feet horizontal accuracy at the 95 % confidence level using National Standard Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA).

Digitized features within areas of high vertical relief tested 120 feet horizontal accuracy by other testing procedures. 

All other features are generated by coordinate geometry and based on a framework of accurately located PLSS corner positions used with public information of record. Computed positions of parcel boundaries are not based on individual field surveys. Although tests of randomly selected points may show high accuracy between field and parcel map content, variations between boundary monumentation and legal description of record can and do exist. Caution is necessary in use of land boundary data shown. Contact the Land Management/Land Survey Division for more information.&lt;/horizpar&gt;&lt;/horizpa&gt;&lt;/posacc&gt;&lt;lineage&gt;&lt;srcinfo&gt;&lt;srcscale /&gt;&lt;/srcinfo&gt;&lt;procstep&gt;&lt;procdesc&gt;Each county provided parcel polygons and attributes in shape file format with UTM coordinates, to the Metropolitan Council.

                        watershed district that does not levy a watershed
                        district tax rate.
            Ramsey:     The last character of the district code was used with a

            Scott:      No data.

            Hennepin:   No data.
            Ramsey:     Uses CAMA codes.  Dwelling and commercial tables 
                        were aggregated and a lookup table was developed to 
                        produce structure descriptions.


SALE_DATE:  Date of last sale.  In general this includes all "arm's length" 
            transactions and would not, for example, include a sale to a family 
            member for $1.  This may vary by county.
              
            Carver:     Includes all sales.
            Dakota:     Month and year of last QUALIFIED SALE (day not part of
                        attributes available). Day of the month is fictitious 
                        (set to the 1st of the month to conform to date field
                        FORMAT).
            Ramsey:     The CAMA valid sales were used.  Data exist for 39% of
                        parcels.
            Washington: No values newer than 8/14/2000 and no data for 
                        Woodbury.

 
SALE_VALUE: Value of last sale.
 
            Anoka:      Field is partially populated.
            Ramsey:     The CAMA valid sales were used.  Data exist for 39% 
                        of parcels.


PARC_CODE:  Parcel Polygon to Parcel Point and PIN Relationship Code. This 
            field is used to provide information about the relationship between 
            parcel polygons, parcel points and unique tax parcel identifiers 
            (PINs). At this time, most counties do not populate this field. 
            Values are: 

            0 = Information not available or not provided
            1 = Valid Parcel with a single tax PIN
            2 = In polygon dataset: Parcel polygon representing multiple tax
                PINs In point dataset: One of multiple parcel points that 
                together are represented by a single polygon

            The values below are likely only to be found in the polygon 
            dataset.  The polygons for which they are assigned are unlikely to 
            have a tax PIN or other parcel attributes. The parcel points 
            datasets, where available, are unlikely to include these feature 
            types.

            17 = Walkway
            98 = Other non-parcel feature
            99 = Unspecified non-parcel feature
