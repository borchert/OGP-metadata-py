			&lt;purpose&gt;The Bicycle and Pedestrian Section, Office of Transit, developed the electronic bikeways map and GIS database to fill the need for a comprehensive inventory of bicycle routes in the Twin Cities metro area.   The bike route data layer represents an interconnected regional network of bikeways that meet basic standards as developed by the Metro Bikeway Mapping Advisory Committee and helps to meet the region's goal of increased and safe transportation options.

The map will serve to show existing inventory of bikeways and identify cost-effective bicycle infrastructure opportunities that will interface with local projects.  The goal is to provide planning guidance to build a bicycle transportation network for the Twin Cities metro area.&lt;/purpose&gt;

			&lt;current&gt;The bikeways maps for the nine-county metro area represent route information from 2001 to 2007.

The initial bikeways data set was digitized in 2003.  Additional bikeways were digitized 2004 through 2007.  MNDOT BaseMap road centerlines were used for the location of the majority of bikeways.

MNDOT did the original digitization of road centerlines during the 1990-1995 time period.  Roads were updated in January 2001 and again in 2002 using the most up-to-date available information.  MNDOT BaseMap centerline information varies in currentness for the nine counties.  For example, Washington was updated in 2003, Hennepin and Ramsey were updated in 2004.

Bikeways were identified and classified based on the information from the following sources:

			&lt;attraccr&gt;Variable.  Existing and proposed trails were attributed according to source information, which vary in accuracy and currentness. Many attributes were unknown and so were left blank.

During bikeway digitization, the Metro Bicycle Network (MBN) map book was used as the primary source for bike route entry where associated information from the MBN was assigned to each bikeway.  Other map sources were used for substantiation.  In addition, city and county data were used to corroborate and/or update the MBN layer.

Datasets will be sent to individual cities for review and correction as the mapping continues.

LMIC converted the data set to a geodatabase format with constrained picklists for many attributes; this change will help to standardize future updates.

NOTE:
A single line may represent either an on-street bikeway or an off-street bikeway or both.  Both single and/or multiple bikeways that follow the same road centerline are represented by a single line and are distinguished by attribute code values - see Entity and Attribute Section.&lt;/attraccr&gt;
		&lt;/attracc&gt;
		&lt;logic&gt;The arcs were not created to support network analysis. Most bikeway arcs are unbroken where they cross roads, however, some areas, such as the city of Woodbury, broke the bikeway arc where it crossed a road.&lt;/logic&gt;
		&lt;complete&gt;The bikeways layer is complete in that there are bicycle route data recorded for each of the nine metropolitan counties. To the extent that all existing bikeways have been located and included, the dataset is incomplete.

Data current to April 2007 (for specific municipalities); bikeways will be updated as new/corrected information is made available.&lt;/complete&gt;
		&lt;posacc&gt;
			&lt;horizpa&gt;
				&lt;horizpar&gt;Trails are aligned to MNDOT BaseMap Roads where appropriate.

The positional accuracy of the data set has not been tested under the National Standards for Spatial Data Accuracy.  Trails were placed according to source information, which varied in accuracy.

Location accuracy for most of the bikeways depends on the location accuracy of the road centerlines. MNDOT derived the road centerline features from USGS 7.5-minute quadrangles and their accuracy cannot be assumed to exceed National Map Accuracy Standards for 1:24,000 scale maps (+/- 40 feet or 12 meters).

If an off-street bikeway followed along road centerlines within proximity of approximately 10-50 feet of the road centerline, the centerline was used as the source.&lt;/horizpar&gt;

				&lt;procdesc&gt;Processing steps:

Phase 1
Metropolitan Bikeways Network maps were created in 2000-2002 by having city and county staff representatives code streets on a laminated street map by placing colored tape on streets or parks where some form of bike route was known.

Phase 2
The Bikeways data layer was digitized in 2003 from the Metropolitan Bikeways Network (MBN) using ArcView 3.2 and the Bikeways Extension.  MNDOT staff developed this extension.  It is a tool for automating the bikeways creation procedure.  Bikeways were digitized using two methods:  a) bikeways identified on the MBN (or city or county-supplied maps) were digitized by selecting the road centerline and the Bikeways extension entered it into the database;  b)  heads-up digitization was employed when a bikeway did not follow a road centerline.  Background aerial photography was used to place the bikeway alignment as close to the source data as possible.

Bikeways were located on the most current version of MNDOT road centerlines and converted in a separate layer using the MNDOT Bikeway mapping tool. Each line segment was coded to reflect the bikeway classification type, its position in relation to the road, if known, and the source of information.

Primarily existing bikeways were entered during this phase.

Phase 3
In 2004 digitization continued in the manner described above, with 'proposed' bikeways being entered in addition to 'existing'.

Phase 4
The Land Management Information Center updated the data set for the following cities, townships and county:  Albertville, Brooklyn Park, Buffalo, Burns Township, Deephaven, Edina, Excelsior, Medicine Lake, Monticello, Mounds View, Oakdale, Vadnais Heights, White Bear Township, Washington County and Woodbury.

Phase 5

In late 2006, LMIC updated the dataset. Cities added or updated: Clearwater, Corcoran, Delano, Hastings, Hugo, Minneapolis, Otsego, Rockford, St. Louis Park, St. Michael, St. Paul, Wayzata, Three Rivers District.

Phase 6

In early 2007, Minneapolis and Ramsey County data were updated. 

Source Materials:

1. Bikeways locations and attributes came from the cities and townships. For Brooklyn Park, Eden Prairie and Woodbury, the source data was submitted as shapefiles; for the remaining updated areas, the source data was submitted as printed maps or PDFs. The date that the map was received from each city or township is recorded in the DATE attribute.

2. Farm Service Agency natural color, 1-meter air photos, summer 2003, were available for the entire 9-county area.
http://www.lmic.state.mn.us/chouse/airphoto_usda.html#fsa

3. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency natural color, 0.3-meter air photos, spring 2004, were available for the St. Paul/Minneapolis city area.

5. Bikeways in all updated cities, except St. Paul, were added by digitizing from a map submitted in PDF form. St. Paul submitted a bikeways shapefile. Aerial Photos (2004 National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) 1 foot and 2003 National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) 1 meter images) were used as references. 

6. Minneapolis and Ramsey County submitted shapefiles which were transferred into the existing bikeways dataset. Data and attributes were verified. 

The addition of Ramsey County data corrupted some planned/proposed St. Paul bikeways. Metropolitan Council staff verified segments within St. Paul against existing and planned St. Paul bikeways files from 2006. Data is correct as of April 2007. 

Processing Steps:

Shapefiles: All the arcs that were not already included in the Bikeways data set were copied and pasted into the data set. The lines were not altered, however, NGA air photos were used to determine whether the trails were paved or unpaved if that attribute was not specified in the submitted shapefile.

Maps:  Printed maps were scanned and georectified using ArcGIS software. Bikeways were then digitized using air photos (either FSA 2003 or NGA 2004); if a bikeway was not visible on the photos (usually in the case of proposed trails), then the line was digitized from the georeferenced map image. Trails along roadways follow MNDOT road line segments; the Trace tool was used to follow the segments exactly.

Near the end of the project, the data was converted from shapefiles to an ArcGIS 8.3 geodatabase with constrained picklists in order to standardize entry of many of the attributes.&lt;/procdesc&gt;
