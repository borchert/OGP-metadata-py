They were initially created by the Minnesota Department of Transportation.  The seven county Twin Cities region is divided into 1165 zones.

In most cases TAZ boundaries align with Census block boundaries.  Population and household data comes from the 1990 and 2000 Census and is aggregated to each TAZ.  Employement data comes from the Minnesota Department of Economic Security and is also aggregated to each TAZ.

Please note that as of early 2004, this set of TAZs was no longer being used for travel demand modeling, socioeconomic forecasts and community comprehensive plan development.  Contact Bob Padock for more information (See contact person in Section 1 of this metadata).

This dataset includes attributes from both 1990 and 2000 (see Section 5 for more information).

Notes:
- Residential and Employment density calculations are considered to be general numbers for trend analysis metro wide.  Due to limitations in the positional accuracy of TAZ boundaries and generalized land use interpretation methods, it would be inappropriate to rely on the density figures to be an accurate reflection of the employment or residential density in any given TAZ.  Also, the density relates to that part of the TAZ with the given type of land use, and not the TAZ as a whole.
- In August of 2003, attributes for 2000 were added to the 1990 TAZ dataset to create this dataset.
- The TAZ dataset that existed prior to August, 2003 (for 1990 only) was found to have some inaccuracies in some of the residential and employment density values.  They have been corrected in this dataset.
- On 12/29/2000 the boundaries of TAZs 629, 632 &amp; 633 were corrected.
- TAZ boundaries that are coincident with county and municipal boundaries do not match the more accurate county and municipal boundary layer used by the Metropolitan Council.
- These 1990 TAZ boundaries have significant positional differences when compared to the 2000 boundaries of the same TAZes.</field><field name="MaxY">45.415</field><field name="MinY">44.471</field><field name="MinX">-94.012</field><field name="MaxX">-92.732</field><field name="ContentDate">1990-01-01T00:00:00Z</field><field name="Location">{"download": "ftp://gisftp.metc.state.mn.us/TAZ1990_2000.zip", "ArcGISRest": "http://gis2.metc.state.mn.us/ArcGIS/rest/services/MetroGIS/Transportation/MapServer/export"}</field><field name="WorkspaceName" /><field name="FgdcText">&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;&lt;metadata&gt;&lt;idinfo&gt;&lt;citation&gt;&lt;citeinfo&gt;&lt;origin&gt;Metropolitan Council&lt;/origin&gt;&lt;pubdate&gt;20030807&lt;/pubdate&gt;&lt;title&gt;Transportation Analysis Zones: 1990 - 2000&lt;/title&gt;&lt;mgmg1cid&gt;N/A&lt;/mgmg1cid&gt;&lt;pubinfo&gt;&lt;publish&gt;Metropolitan Council&lt;/publish&gt;&lt;/pubinfo&gt;&lt;onlink&gt;ftp://gisftp.metc.state.mn.us/TAZ1990_2000.zip&lt;/onlink&gt;&lt;/citeinfo&gt;&lt;/citation&gt;&lt;descript&gt;&lt;abstract&gt;Transportation analysis zones are subdivisions of geographical areas that are delineated for travel analysis and modeling purposes.

The positional accuracy of the dataset is UNKNOWN.

Boundary lines are generally based on 1990 Census block boundaries.  TAZ boundaries that are coincident with county and municipal boundaries do not match the more accurate county and municipal boundary layer used by the Metropolitan Council.&lt;/horizpar&gt;&lt;/horizpa&gt;&lt;/posacc&gt;&lt;lineage&gt;&lt;srcinfo&gt;&lt;srcscale /&gt;&lt;/srcinfo&gt;&lt;procstep&gt;&lt;procdesc&gt;TAZ GEOGRAPHY:

The TAZ layer was created initially by staff at the Minnesota Department of Transportation.  The layer was imported into an Arc/Info environment at the Metropolitan Council in the mid 1990s.  Since that time the Council has modified the attributes in the layer, but not the geography.


POPULATION AND EMPLOYMENT VALUES:

The population and household data for each TAZ is aggregated from block level census data.  In most cases, census blocks fit neatly into each TAZ.  In the few cases where they did not, a determination was made as to the appropriate TAZ in which to include the block, based on the general location of population within the block.

Employment data was recieved from the Minnesota Department of Economic Security MNDES.   For 1990, MNDES aggregated the employment data to each TAZ.  For 2000, MNDES provided the Metropolitan Council a file of employer address that the Metropolitan Council address matched and aggregated to each TAZ.  In a few cases, the employment numbers for a TAZ did not meet the discloser thresholds required by MNDES.  In such cases, the numbers were adjusted with a neighboring TAZ to prevent disclosure.  This was more common with retail employment numbers than with total employment.


RESIDENTIAL AND EMPLOYMENT ACRES:

The residential and employment acres for each TAZ were derived from the Metropolitan Council's Generalized Land Use dataset.  (See http://www.datafinder.org/metadata/GeneralizedLandUseHistorical.htm for more information.)  The acreages consist of the following land use classes for each year (Note: Land use categories differed in the two years):

1990 Residential:
1 = Single Family
2 = Muli-family
11 = Farmstead

1990 Employment:
3 = Commercial
4 = Industrial
5 = Public Semi-Public
6 = Airports 

2000 Residential:
111 = Farmstead 
112 = Seasonal/Vacation 
113 = Single Family Detached 
114 = Single Family Attached 
115 = Multifamily 
116 = Manufactured Housing Parks 


2000 Employment:
120 = Retail and Other Commercial 
130 = Office 
141 = Mixed Use Residential 
142 = Mixed Use Industrial 
143 = Mixed Use Commercial and Other 
151 = Industrial and Utility 
160 = Institutional 
203 = Airport 


See the Generalized Land Use metadata at  http://www.datafinder.org/metadata/GeneralizedLandUseHistorical.htm#eainfo for a more detailed description of these land use classes.


RESIDENTIAL AND EMPLOYMENT DENSITY

Residential and Employment density calculations are considered to be general numbers for trend analysis metro wide.  Due to limitations in the positional accuracy of TAZ boundaries and generalized land use interpretation methods, it would be inappropriate to rely on the density figures to be an accurate reflection of the employment or residential density in any given TAZ.  The density relates to that part of the TAZ with the given type of land use, and not the TAZ as a whole.  Some density values may be very skewed do to positional accuracy issues with the alignment of TAZ boundaries as compared to the land use data.&lt;/procdesc&gt;&lt;/procstep&gt;&lt;/lineage&gt;&lt;/dataqual&gt;&lt;spdoinfo&gt;&lt;indspref&gt;TAZ ID  number&lt;/indspref&gt;&lt;direct&gt;Vector&lt;/direct&gt;&lt;mgmg3obj&gt;polygon shapes&lt;/mgmg3obj&gt;&lt;mgmg3til&gt;One layer for entire seven county region.&lt;/mgmg3til&gt;&lt;/spdoinfo&gt;&lt;eainfo&gt;&lt;overview&gt;&lt;eaover&gt;POLYGON ATTRIBUTES:
