A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county.  Not all attributes are populated for all counties.

This is an annual version of the MetroGIS Regional Parcel Dataset that can be used with other annual versions to do change analysis and time series investigations.  This dataset is intended to contain all updates to each county's parcel data through the end of 2002.  It was originally published as the "January 1, 2003" version of the dataset.  See the Currentness Reference below and the Entity and Attribute information in Section 5 for more information about the dates for specific aspects of the dataset.

Some counties have also made available a parcel points dataset that includes the same attribute fields.  This is done to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon.

This is a MetroGIS Regionally Endorsed dataset.  (See http://www.metrogis.org/data/about/index.shtml#whatis for more information.)

Not all tax parcels are represented by a unique polygon.   For example, a county might have one polygon representing a condominium complex.  Some counties have provided an additional parcel points shape file that will include points to represent such tax parcels (e.g. a point for each individual condominium).&lt;/logic&gt;&lt;complete&gt;For parcel attributes, see Section 5 of this metadata.
For parcel geography, see metadata for individual counties.&lt;/complete&gt;&lt;posacc&gt;&lt;horizpa&gt;&lt;horizpar&gt;ANOKA:   No information provided.


CARVER:  The Horizontal Accuracy of the counties parcel dataset is, for the most part, UNDER 1' accuracy. This is possible because the County's Surveyor used COGO (Coordinate Geometry) which is a highly accurate way of plotting parcel lines. 


DAKOTA:  90% less than 2.0 feet 


HENNEPIN:  Estimated to be +or- 2 to 4 feet at section corners. Positional accuracy decreases with distance from section corners.


RAMSEY:  Digitized information is generally +or- 7 feet; some areas have been found to be +or- 30 feet. Cogo (coordinate geometry) accuracy generally is +or- 1.0 foot. 


SCOTT:  No information provided.


WASHINGTON:  Digitized features outside areas of high vertical relief (e.g. major river valleys) tested 23 feet horizontal accuracy at the 95 % confidence level using National Standard Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA).

Digitized features within areas of high vertical relief tested 120 feet horizontal accuracy by other testing procedures. 

All other features are generated by coordinate geometry and based on a framework of accurately located PLSS corner positions used with public information of record. Computed positions of parcel boundaries are not based on individual field surveys. Although tests of randomly selected points may show high accuracy between field and parcel map content, variations between boundary monumentation and legal description of record can and do exist. Caution is necessary in use of land boundary data shown. Contact the Land Management/Land Survey Division for more information.&lt;/horizpar&gt;&lt;/horizpa&gt;&lt;/posacc&gt;&lt;lineage&gt;&lt;srcinfo&gt;&lt;srcscale /&gt;&lt;/srcinfo&gt;&lt;procstep&gt;&lt;procdesc&gt;Each county provided parcel polygons and attributes in shape file format to the Metropolitan Council.  The Metropolitan Council checked each shape file to insure it had all desired attribute fields, field names, types and lengths.  If the county parcel dataset was provided in a county coordinate system, it was projected to UTM by the Metropolitan Council.

No attempt was made to edgematch or rubber sheet the parcel geography between counties.&lt;/procdesc&gt;&lt;/procstep&gt;&lt;/lineage&gt;&lt;/dataqual&gt;&lt;spdoinfo&gt;&lt;indspref&gt;None&lt;/indspref&gt;&lt;direct&gt;Vector&lt;/direct&gt;&lt;mgmg3obj&gt;polygon shapes&lt;/mgmg3obj&gt;&lt;mgmg3til&gt;One shape file for each of the seven counties.&lt;/mgmg3til&gt;&lt;/spdoinfo&gt;&lt;eainfo&gt;&lt;overview&gt;&lt;eaover&gt;A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county; however, not

            (PINs).  It is new to the MetroGIS Regional Parcel Dataset with the 
            January, 2003 update.  At this time, most counties do not populate 
            this field.  Values are:

            0 = not available or not provided
            1 = Valid Parcel (single taxpin)

                polygon dataset)
            3 = One of multiple parcel points that together are represented by
