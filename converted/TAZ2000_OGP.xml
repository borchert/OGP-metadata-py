This system is a modification of that developed jointly by the Minnesota Department of Transportation and the Metropolitan Council in late 1989, referred to as Transportation Analysis Zones, 1990 or TAZ1990.  The principal difference between the 1990 and 2000 systems is that 27 TAZs were subdivided into smaller units, thus expanding the total number of TAZs from 1165 to 1201. 

Notes: 

- The geography for this file is based on the Twin Cities Regional Travel Demand Forecast Model. Attributes included are population, households, total employment, retail employment, and non-retail employment for the years 2000, 2010, 2020 and 2030.

- As of early 2004, this set of TAZs became the official TAZ system for travel demand modeling, socioeconomic forecasts and community comprehensive plan development, in addition to its existing use for the 2000 Census Transportation Planning Package (CTPP).

- Where TAZs were split, significant boundary alignment differences exist between the 1990 and 2000 TAZ datasets.

- Generally, the 2000 TAZ system utilized 1998 TIGER line files for boundaries, which do not necessarily match the line files typically used with other Council generated GIS datasets. Because of this, some boundary lines take on a different appearance in instances where the more positionally accurate line doesn't follow acceptable TIGER boundary features.</field><field name="MaxY">45.415</field><field name="MinY">44.471</field><field name="MinX">-94.012</field><field name="MaxX">-92.732</field><field name="ContentDate">2008-01-01T00:00:00Z</field><field name="Location">{"download": "ftp://gisftp.metc.state.mn.us/TAZ2000.zip", "ArcGISRest": "http://gis2.metc.state.mn.us/ArcGIS/rest/services/MetroGIS/Transportation/MapServer/export"}</field><field name="WorkspaceName" /><field name="FgdcText">&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;&lt;metadata&gt;&lt;idinfo&gt;&lt;citation&gt;&lt;citeinfo&gt;&lt;origin&gt;Metropolitan Council&lt;/origin&gt;&lt;pubdate&gt;20120504&lt;/pubdate&gt;&lt;title&gt;Transportation Analysis Zones 2000&lt;/title&gt;&lt;mgmg1cid&gt;N/A&lt;/mgmg1cid&gt;&lt;pubinfo&gt;&lt;publish&gt;Metropolitan Council&lt;/publish&gt;&lt;/pubinfo&gt;&lt;onlink&gt;ftp://gisftp.metc.state.mn.us/TAZ2000.zip&lt;/onlink&gt;&lt;/citeinfo&gt;&lt;/citation&gt;&lt;descript&gt;&lt;abstract&gt;Transportation analysis zones are subdivisions of geographical areas that are delineated for land use and travel analysis purposes.

Boundary lines are generally based on 2000 Census block boundaries.  TAZ boundaries that are coincident with county and municipal boundaries do not match the more accurate county and municipal boundary layer used by the Metropolitan Council.&lt;/horizpar&gt;&lt;/horizpa&gt;&lt;/posacc&gt;&lt;lineage&gt;&lt;srcinfo&gt;&lt;srcscale /&gt;&lt;/srcinfo&gt;&lt;procstep&gt;&lt;procdesc&gt;TAZ GEOGRAPHY:

Generally came from Tiger data received in 1999.  Metropolitan Council projected to UTM, NAD83 Meters and combined counties. Then TAZ IDs  and attributes were added by Metropolitan Council staff. 


POPULATION AND EMPLOYMENT VALUES:

The year-2000 population and household data for each TAZ is aggregated from block level census data.  In most cases, census blocks fit neatly into each TAZ.  In the few cases where they did not, a determination was made as to the appropriate TAZ in which to include the block, based on the general location of population within the block.

Employment data for the year-2000 was received from the Minnesota Department of Economic Security MNDES.   MNDES provided the Metropolitan Council a file of employer address that the Metropolitan Council address matched and aggregated to each TAZ.  In a few cases, the employment numbers for a TAZ did not meet the discloser thresholds required by MNDES.  In such cases, the numbers were adjusted with a neighboring TAZ to prevent disclosure.  This was more common with retail employment numbers than with total employment.

The 2010 through 2030 population and employment data are based on city forecasts as of January 9, 2008.  Their distributions result from community Comprehensive Plan updates.&lt;/procdesc&gt;&lt;/procstep&gt;&lt;procstep&gt;&lt;procdesc&gt;TAZ GEOGRAPHY:
