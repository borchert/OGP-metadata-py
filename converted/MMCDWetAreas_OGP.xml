It was developed by MMCD for internal use and is not intended to imply jurisdictional wetland boundaries. It generally includes swamps, marshes, roadside ditches, small shallow ponds and other water-holding features down to 0.01 acre in size. It may include vegetated lake margins but does not generally include large bodies of open water. 

All features were manually digitized from orthorectified digital aerial photography (for example, statewide FSA), and most have been field checked for approximate location and size at least once in the last 5 years. The actual extent of water will vary seasonally and annually with rainfall. The extent of water shown in this dataset tends to reflect conditions at the time the aerial photos were taken but may be modified based on field experience.

For detailed info on the positional accuracy of these photos see http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/chouse/metadata/naip08.html and http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/chouse/wms/wms_image_server_layers.html. 
Many sites were field checked during 2011, especially those treated frequently (see http://www.mmcd.org web map for access to inspection and treatment data).

The scale at which lines were digitized varied as staff zoomed in and out while heads-up digitizing within MapInfo, however most lines were digitized at an on-screen scale of no higher than 1:3000. For smaller wet areas, 1:1500 was more common. 

As a general rule when developing this dataset it was the MMCD's intention to meet or exceed the National Mapping Accuracy Standards at 1:24,000 (within approximately 40 feet of actual location). No testing has been conducted to verify this.&lt;/horizpar&gt;&lt;/horizpa&gt;&lt;/posacc&gt;&lt;lineage&gt;&lt;procstep&gt;&lt;procdesc&gt;Water feature boundaries were heads-up digitized from 1.0-0.3 meter digital orthophotos. The scale at which lines were digitized varied as staff zoomed in and out while heads-up digitizing within MapInfo, however most lines were digitized at an on-screen scale of no higher than 1:3000. For smaller wet areas, 1:1500 was more common.

Many open water areas have been removed as these areas do not support mosquito larval development, but the dataset may still include some smaller open water features.&lt;/procdesc&gt;&lt;/procstep&gt;&lt;srcinfo&gt;&lt;srcscale /&gt;&lt;/srcinfo&gt;&lt;/lineage&gt;&lt;/dataqual&gt;&lt;spdoinfo&gt;&lt;indspref&gt;None&lt;/indspref&gt;&lt;direct&gt;Vector&lt;/direct&gt;&lt;mgmg3obj /&gt;&lt;mgmg3til&gt;One layer for entire metro area&lt;/mgmg3til&gt;&lt;/spdoinfo&gt;&lt;eainfo&gt;&lt;overview&gt;&lt;eaover&gt;Sitecode - A unique code for each wetland in the 7-county metro area,
           based on MMCD's County, City, Section and Site codes. 

Acres    - Area calculated by MapInfo from polygons as drawn.

Type     - The first digit of type is based on the Circular 39 wetland
           typing system.  The digit after the "." is an MMCD code
           referring to the predominant vegetation, as follows: 
  Type 1 - Temporary water; usually well-drained during much of the 
           growing season.
     1.1 - Open field, usually grass.
     1.2 - Woodland pool or Floodplain forest; could produce both spring 
           and summer mosquitoes
     1.3 - Woodland pool, only spring mosquitoes produced
  Type 2 - Temporary water; typically dries out at some time during the 
           year but may stay waterlogged.
     2.1 - Reed canary grass, predominantly. No cattail.
     2.2 - Sedge meadow, predominantly. No cattail.
     2.3 - Assorted aquatic plants (not cattail not predominantly reed 
           canary grass or sedge)
  Type 3 - Temporary water; wet or waterlogged most of year in wet 
           years, may dry out in midsummer or dry years.
     3.1 - Majority reed canary grass and sedge, remainder mostly 
           cattail
     3.2 - Majority cattail, remainder reed canary grass and sedge
  Type 4 - Permanent water, usually ca. 3 ft deep
     4.1 - Vegetative band mostly canary grass and sedges; perm. open 
           water area less than area covered by vegetation
     4.2 - Vegetative band mostly cattails or broadleaf plants; open 
           water area less than area covered by vegetation
     4.3 - Majority of site is open water; narrow band of cattail, 
           grass, sedge or other vegetation
     4.4 - Majority open water; steep banks, very little emergent 
           vegetation (ex: golf hazards, "duck ponds")
  Type 5 - ca. 10 ft. deep, may contain game fish
     5.1 - Most vegetation grass and sedge, some cattail; open water 
           area less than area covered by vegetation
     5.2 - Mostly cattails and/or broadleafs, some grass or sedge; open 
           water area less than area covered by vegetation
     5.3 - Majority of site is open water; narrow bands of cattail, 
           grass, sedge or other vegetation
     5.4 - Shallow pond or reservoir that does not contain game fish 
           (including panfish)
  Type 6 - Shrub swamp; usually waterlogged during growing season.
     6.0 - (only type used)
  Type 7 - Wooded swamp
     7.0 - Usually tamarack
  Type 8 - Bog
     8.1 - Poorly drained, wet spongy ground rich in plant residue
     8.2 - Floating mat

Some sites that have not been visited recently may not have a type assigned.

MMCD keeps records of estimated % wet when we check these sites.  If 
there are particular sites you are interested in you can check records 
for the last several years using the web map at www.mmcd.org, or contact
