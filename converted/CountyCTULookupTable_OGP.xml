These are termed Minor Civil Division (MCDs) by the Census Bureau.  The table encompases the Twin Cities 7-county metropolitan area.  It is intended to be a Council wide master lookup table for these entites.  It contains official federal and state unique identifiers for CTUs and MCDs as well as identifiers created and used by other organizations.  The table also contains historical MCDs dating back to the 1990s and a few other non-MCD records that are of importance to Met. Council use of this table.

NOTES:

- On 3/17/2011 it was discovered that the CTU ID used for the City of Lake St. Croix Beach was incorrect.  It was changed from 2394379 to 2395599 to match GNIS.

- On 3/17/2011 it was discovered that the CTU ID used for the City of Lilydale was incorrect.  It was changed from 2394457 to 2395708 to match GNIS.

- On 11/9/2010 it was discovered that the CTU ID used for the City of Crystal was incorrect.  It was changed from 2393541 to 2393683 to match GNIS.

- Effective April 2008,  a change was made in GNIS to match the FIPS place codes to the "civil" feature for each city instead of the "populated place" feature.  Both cities and townships are now "civil" features within GNIS.  This means that the official GNIS unique ID for every city in Minnesota has changed.  See full notice on change here: http://www.datafinder.org/notices/gnis_update.asp 

- As of January 1, 2006, the five digit FIPS 55-3 Place codes that were used as unique identifiers in this dataset (CTU_CODE and COCTU_CODE fields) were officially retired by the Federal governement.  They are replaced by a set of integer codes from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS_CODE field).  Both codes will be kept in this database, but the GNIS_CODE is considered the official unique identifier from this point forward.  The GNIS codes are also slated to become official ANSI codes for these geographic features.  While GNIS treats these codes as 6 to 8 digit integer data types, the Census Bureau formats them as 8 digit text fields, right justified with leading zeros included.

- The Census Bureau will continue to create FIPS 55 Place codes for new cities and townships through the 2010 Census.  After that, no new FIPS 55 codes will be created.  Note that for townships that wholly incorporate into cities, the same FIPS 55 code will be used for the new city.  (GNIS creates a new ID for the new city.)

- Cities and townships have also been referred to as ''MCDs'' (a Census term), however this term technically refers to the part of each city or township within a single county.  Thus, a few cities in the metro area that are split by county boundaries are actually comprised of two different MCDs. This was part of the impetus for a proposed MN state data standard that uses the ''CTU'' terminology for clarity.

-  A variety of civil divisions of the land exist within the United States.  In Minnesota, only three types exist - cities, townships and unorganized territories.  All three of these exist within the Twin Cities seven county area.  The only unorganized territory is Fort Snelling (a large portion of which is occupied by the MSP International Airport).

-  Some cities are split between two counties.  Only those parts of cities within the 7-county area are included.

- Prior to the 2000 census, the FIPS Place code for the City of Greenwood in Hennepin County was changed from 25928 to 25918.  This dataset reflects that change.</field><field name="MaxY">45.4</field><field name="MinY">44.4</field><field name="MinX">-94.0</field><field name="MaxX">-92.7</field><field name="ContentDate">2014-04-01T00:00:00Z</field><field name="Location">{"download": "ftp://gisftp.metc.state.mn.us/CountiesAndCTUs.zip"}</field><field name="WorkspaceName" /><field name="FgdcText">&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;&lt;metadata&gt;&lt;idinfo&gt;&lt;citation&gt;&lt;citeinfo&gt;&lt;title&gt;County CTU Lookup Table&lt;/title&gt;&lt;origin&gt;Metropolitan Council&lt;/origin&gt;&lt;pubinfo&gt;&lt;publish&gt;Metropolitan Council&lt;/publish&gt;&lt;/pubinfo&gt;&lt;pubdate&gt;Periodically revised&lt;/pubdate&gt;&lt;onlink&gt;ftp://gisftp.metc.state.mn.us/CountiesAndCTUs.zip&lt;/onlink&gt;&lt;/citeinfo&gt;&lt;/citation&gt;&lt;descript&gt;&lt;abstract&gt;This is a lookup table within Oracle containing various data related to cities, townships, unorganized territories (CTUs) and any divisions created by county boundaries splitting them.

GNIS identifiers are taken from the U.S. Board of Geographic Names GNIS database at http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/index.html . 

FIPS "Place" codes (CTU_CODE) are taken from the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 55-3 database dated September, 2001.  Updated FIPS codes are obtained from the GNIS database or the Census Bureau.

Other codes are taken from various sources.  Population figures are from the Metropolitan Council Research Unit.&lt;/procdesc&gt;&lt;/procstep&gt;&lt;srcinfo&gt;&lt;srcscale /&gt;&lt;/srcinfo&gt;&lt;/lineage&gt;&lt;/dataqual&gt;&lt;spdoinfo&gt;&lt;indspref&gt;CTU ID, County code, CTU code, county name, CTU name, COCTU ID, COCTU code&lt;/indspref&gt;&lt;direct /&gt;&lt;mgmg3obj /&gt;&lt;mgmg3til /&gt;&lt;/spdoinfo&gt;&lt;eainfo&gt;&lt;overview&gt;&lt;eaover&gt;Attributes for County CTU Lookup Table:
 
COCTU_ID:   11 digit identifier for the combination of county and CTU 
            (concatination of CO_CODE and CTU_ID_CEN).  This is the 
            official U.S. Census Bureau format.

COCTU_CODE: 8 digit code (concatenation of CO_CODE and CTU_CODE below).
            As of 2006 the FIPS55 codes upon which the CTU_CODEs based, 
            have been official retired by the federal governement.  They 
            are replaced by the GNIS codes used in the COCTU_ID field 
            described above.  The retired codes will continue to be 
            included in this dataset, but codes will not be created for 
            new cities after the 2010 Census.
 
CO_CODE:    3 digit ID for the county in which the MCD resides.  This is the 
            official state and federal county code and is to be treated as text 
            with leading zeros. e.g. 163, 003

CTU_ID:     The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) official federal
            unique identifier for each city, township or unorganized territory.
            This field is an integer data type of 6 to 7 digits.

CTU_ID_CEN: This is a text representation of the CTU_ID above.  This format is 
            used by the Census Bureau (8 digits, right justified with leading
            zeros included).

CTU_CODE:   5 digit FIPS55 'Place' code for CTU.  As of 2006 these codes have 
            been official retired by the federal government.  They are replaced
            by the GNIS codes above. The Census Bureau will continue to create
            FIPS55 Place codes for new cities and townships through the 2010
            Census.  After that, no new FIPS55 codes will be created. Note that
            for townships that wholly incorporate into cities, the same FIPS55
            code for the former township will usually be used for the new city. 
            Conversely, GNIS creates a new ID for the new city.

CTU_NAME:   Name of the city, township or unorganized territory - format 1.  
            e.g. Burns Twp., Blaine

CTU_NAME2:  Name of the city, township or unorganized territory - format 2.
            e.g. Burns Township, Blaine

CTU_NAME3:  Name of the city, township or unorganized territory - format 3.
            e.g. Township of Burns, City of Blaine

CTU_NAME4:  Name of the city, township or unorganized territory - format 4
            e.g. Burns, Township of; Blaine, City of

CTU_NAME5:  Name of the city, township or unorganized territory - format 5
            e.g. Burns, Blaine

COCTU_DESC: Description of the COCTU, including portion of county and 
            historical designation if applicable; 
            e.g. Burns Township, Blaine (Anoka Co. part), Elko (historical)

CTU_PARTEX: Indicates that the whole city is part external
            T = Whole city has part that is external to seven county metro.
            F = Whole city is within seven county metro.

CO_NAME:    Name of the county (e.g. Carver)
 
CTU_ABBREV: 6 character unique abbreviation for the CTU developed by Met. 
            Council GIS staff for file naming purposes  e.g. ANDOVE, ANOKAX.

COMCD_CENS: The Census Bureau's old 6 digit county-MCD code 
            (concatenation of FIPS county code and old Census MCD code)
            This code was retired in the 1990s.
 
CTU_TYPE:   Type of CTU
            C = city
            T = township
            U = unorganized territory
            O = other (not a CTU, but useful as an entity in this table 
                e.g. MSP airport,)

CTU_STATUS: Indicates status of CTU
            A = Active CTU
            H = Historic CTU
            P = Pending CTU

DUP_CTYTWP: Identifies cities and townships with the same name (e.g. City of 
            Vermillion and Vermillion Township)
 
ABC_SORT:   3 digit integer that will sort alphabetically e.g. 'St.' is 
            sorted as 'Saint'
 
FIVE_COLOR: Numbers 1 to 5 for shading polygons so that adjacent CTUs have 
            different colors.

MCDIST2003: Metropolitan Council District number in which the MCD resides, as
            enacted in 2003.  Districts are numbered 1-16.  Six cities are 
            split into multiple districts.  Three of these (Hastings, Spring
            Lake Park and Chanhassen) are split along county boundaries.  Thus 
            each of the two record for each of those cities within this table
            have a distinct value in this field.  The other three cities are not
            split by county bundaries and thus have only one record each in this 
            table.  These cities have been given an alternate value in this field.
            Eagan = 97 (split into districts 15 and 16).  Minneapolis = 98 (split 
            into districts (6,7 and 8).  St. Paul = 99 (split into districts 14 
            and 15).  Cities exempt from Council jurisdiction are coded as 0.  
            Also see the MCDistByCTU field for a list of all 2013 Council Districts
            within each CTU.

MCDIST1993: Metropolitan Council District number in which the MCD resides, as 
            enacted in 1993.  Districts are numbered 1-16.  Three cities are 
            split into multiple districts and have been given an alternate 
            value in this dataset.  Maplewood = 96 (split into districts 11 and 
            12).  Minneapolis = 98 (split into districts 6,7 and 8).  St. Paul 
            = 99 (split into districts 13 and 14).  Cities exempt from Council 
            jurisdiction are coded as 0.

MCDistByCTU: The number(s) for the 2013 Metropolitan Council District(s) which 
            exist(s) within the city or township as a whole.  Thus six cities
            have multiple numbers separated by commas within this field. Historical
            CTUs and CTUs exempt from Council jurisdiction have no data.

MCFIN_CODE: The Metropolitan Council Finance Dept. accounting codes for those 
            cities and townships that are connected to Council owned waste 
            water treatment plants and are paying sewer access charges (SAC).  
            Not all cities and townships in the metro area will have a code.

MNREV_CODE: Minnesota Department of Revenue code for CTU; e.g. 1400, 500, 6 
            (unique within county only)

OLD_CO2D:   Old state 2 digit county code (Note 3 digit code is state standard)

CO2D_MNREV: MN Dept. of Revenue code for CTU preceded by 2 digit county code

MNDES_CODE: Minnesota Department of Economic Security 'community' code for 
            CTU, e.g. 0025, 0215  (unique within county only)
 
HENN_CODE:  'Municipal' code used by Hennepin County
 
POP_2000:   2000 population for county-CTU based on the 2000 census (does 
            not including any subsequent corrections of the data by the 
            Census Bureau, if any)

POP_1990:   1990 population for county-CTU based on the 1990 census 
            (including subsequent corrections of the data by the Census 
            Bureau)

ACRES_MCD:  The calculated acreage of the minor civil division based on the 
            quarterly MetroGIS county_ctu dataset.  Note that where cities fall 
            within two counties, each portion is a single MCD.  Both must be 
            summed to get the acreage for the entire city.  Where an MCD 
            contains multiple polygons (in the same county), this field 
            reflects the sum of those polygons.

ACRES_CTU:  The calculated acreage of the entire city, township or unorganized 
            territory based on the quarterly MetroGIS county_ctu dataset.  Note 
            that where a CTU resides within two counties, BOTH records in this 
            MCD table will contain the same total acreage for the entire CTU. 
            All polygons for a CTU are summed to create this acreage.
