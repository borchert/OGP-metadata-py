<h1>OGP-metadata-py</h1>
A simple Python script for creating OpenGeoPortal ingestible metadata from existing FGDC metadata as well as the
Minnesota Geospatial Metadata Guidelines (MGMG).

Very much in a rough state, but improvements are forthcoming.

The script is targeted at those coming from an ArcGIS environment. As such it currently requires the availability of the arcpy module. This dependency will be removed as soon as possible.

Usage details to follow!
